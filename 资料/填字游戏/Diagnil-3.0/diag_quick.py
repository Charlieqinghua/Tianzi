Solve diagramless crossword puzzles by entering words and placing them on a grid, and by making adjustments until the final shape is achieved. Work from lists of word clues obtained from books or newspapers, or open a puzzle file distributed electronically using a supported file format (puz, jpz, xpf, ipuz).

  \N{bullet} The default settings provide for <<bold::keystroke-based grid navigation>>, which should be familiar to those experienced with Across Lite or similar software, although there are differences.

  \N{bullet} An easy puzzle of modest size (11 by 11) is provided to help you learn and practice the software features. Select the <<topic::Sample Grids>> menu item under Help and open the file <<bold::Practice.puz>>.

  \N{bullet} Enter a word by first moving the mouse cursor over either word list panel, then select a clue and type the desired word.

  \N{bullet} <<bold::Pressing the Enter key>> records a word in the list box below. If the mouse cursor is over the grid, the word will also be pasted at the square under the large blue cursor.

  \N{bullet} Selecting a previously entered word from the word list allows it to be edited or pasted on the grid.

  \N{bullet} Clicking on a grid square with the left mouse button sets the cursor position for entering the next word.

  \N{bullet} Clicking the right mouse button over the grid toggles the direction for entering words. If the right button is held down, a menu will pop up, giving you a choice of actions.

  \N{bullet} You can move a word or group of words on the grid using the features on the pop-up menu.

  \N{bullet} Select the <<topic::User's Guide>> from the Help menu for a full description of all features. See the <<topic::Primer>> if you're new to diagramless crosswords.

  \N{bullet} A set of completed sample grids is provided for illustration, available from the <<topic::Sample Grids>> menu item under Help. Try opening one, then add, delete and move words around. First you will need to Undo the finalization step to 'unfreeze' the puzzle.
